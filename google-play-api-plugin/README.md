# Google Play API Gradle Plugin
Gradle Plugin to publish android APKs/bundles and listings on Google Play

## Setup

Add the following configuration to your root `build.gradle`, replacing X.Y.Z by the [latest version](https://github.com/dipien/google-play-api/releases/latest)


    buildscript {
      repositories {
        mavenCentral()
      }
      dependencies {
        classpath 'com.dipien:google-play-api-plugin:X.Y.Z'
      }
    }
    
    apply plugin: 'com.dipien.googleplay.api'

All the plugin configuration properties can be added using any of the following ways:

* Using the **googlePlay** extension on the build.gradle. For example:

      googlePlay {
          applicationId 'com.sample'
      }

* As a command line parameter. For example:

      ./gradlew googlePlayVerifyMetadata -PapplicationId=com.sample

* As a property on a gradle.properties file

      applicationId = 'com.sample'

* As an extra property on the build.gradle

      ext.applicationId = 'com.sample'

* As a System Environment property


#### Common Properties

###### Application Id

The application id of your app. This property is required
    
    applicationId = 'com.sample'
    
###### Private Key Json File Path

Path to the private key json file. This property is required.

For example:

###### Connect Timeout

The connect timeout (in milliseconds) when executing requests against the Google API. The default value is 100 seconds

For example:

    connectTimeout = 200000

###### Read Timeout

The read timeout (in milliseconds) when executing requests against the Google API. The default value is 100 seconds

###### Dry Run

so the state on Google Play is never changed. Dry run is disabled by default.

For example:
